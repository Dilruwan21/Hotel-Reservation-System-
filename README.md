# Hotel-Reservation-System-
A modern, responsive hotel booking website built with React. It features room booking with dynamic deposit calculation (25%), a user-friendly interface, and custom pages like "About Us," "Contact Us," and "Book Now." Optimized for all devices and integration-ready for payments. Perfect for hotels seeking an efficient online reservation system.

Key Features:

Room Booking with 25% Deposit Calculation
The booking system allows users to easily choose their room type (Standard, Deluxe, or Suite), select check-in and check-out dates, and specify the number of guests. It then automatically calculates the total booking cost and displays a 25% deposit, which users must pay to confirm their reservation. This dynamic calculation is handled through React’s state management, providing a real-time update of costs.

React for Dynamic User Interface
The entire website is built using React.js, leveraging its powerful component-based architecture to build interactive and reusable UI elements. Each form, page section, and feature is managed efficiently to ensure a smooth user experience, where changes and updates are handled seamlessly without page reloads.

Responsive Design
The website employs modern CSS techniques for a fully responsive layout, ensuring optimal performance on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. Whether accessing the site from a smartphone or a desktop, users enjoy a consistent and user-friendly experience.

Custom Pages

About Us: A visually appealing page that highlights the hotel’s background, mission, and core values, supported by images of the hotel and its amenities.
Contact Us: An easy-to-use contact form that allows users to send inquiries directly. The page also includes hotel contact details and a map.
Book Now: A fully-functional booking form that allows users to select their room and pay a 25% deposit upfront. The deposit and total amount are dynamically calculated using React, offering users a clear understanding of their payment breakdown.
Room Reservation Management
The booking system handles various room options, date selections, and guest counts while keeping track of the total booking amount. The use of React’s state ensures all inputs and calculations are updated instantly as the user interacts with the form.

Technologies Used:

React.js: To build a dynamic, component-based user interface
CSS3: For responsive, modern design
HTML5: For the structure and layout of the site
JavaScript (ES6+): For handling dynamic interactions and form validation
Optional Payment Integration: The website can easily be integrated with third-party payment gateways to process deposits and full payments securely.
Why React?
React was chosen for this project due to its efficiency in handling dynamic content and real-time updates, making it ideal for a hotel booking website where information such as room availability and pricing may frequently change. React's component-based architecture ensures scalability, making it easier to extend the site’s functionality in the future without compromising performance.

Responsive and User-Friendly
This hotel booking website is designed to provide users with a smooth and straightforward experience. By leveraging React, the site ensures that users can quickly make bookings, see real-time price updates, and pay a deposit all within a responsive, mobile-friendly interface.
